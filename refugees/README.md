# Refugee data

### Associated Press refugee data

The Associated Press is [sharing information](https://data.world/associatedpress/refugee-admissions-to-us-end-fy-2018) on Data.World for free. That data includes tables on refugees between Oct. 1, 2008, and Sept. 30, 2018, refugees by city for the same time period, and refugees and foreign born proportions for cities. Please read the documentation for this data at Data.World, and credit the Associated Press. The original files are in the national folder, while files that begin with co_ are Colorado only.


The [Refugee Processing Center](https://www.wrapsnet.org/admissions-and-arrivals/), part of the Department of State, also publishes annual numbers of refugees by state; prior reports to Congress [documentation in this Google doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LfPx5ncbDNUx-oISWuII33OLCwGxxtryWTlTrDXAMa0/edit?usp=sharing) also provide such information. These reports are typically used in the fall to determine the number of refugees who will be admitted from which countries in the coming year.
