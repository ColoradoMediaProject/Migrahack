### Detention locations

The Marshall Project in cooperation with The Guardian this week published [Detained](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2019/09/24/detained), a look at the history of detention of immigrants. They've made available a [list of locations](https://github.com/themarshallproject/dhs_immigration_detention) that cooperated with detentions that is in this folder. Please read the GitHub documentation. Note that the dates are DD/MM/YYYY format. Please cite them in using this information.

### TRAC

The Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse at Syracuse University obtains information on [immigration detention, removals and more](https://trac.syr.edu/immigration/) via FOIA. There are several great datasets there, but they aren't downloadable. But you may use the data and attribute it to TRAC.

This data is sortable by state and sometimes by county. Again, it isn't downloadable, just viewable.
