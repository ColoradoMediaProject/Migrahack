# Climate-related migration

### Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre

The [Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre](http://www.internal-displacement.org/) tracks people displaced by violence, conflict and disasters around the world. Please read the [methodology](http://www.internal-displacement.org/database/methodology) and cite them in using this information.

One of the files includes all international internal displacements, while the imdc_disaster_dataset includes only disasters with event names where available. Both come from [this page](http://www.internal-displacement.org/database/displacement-data).

Also take a look at [their 2018 report](http://www.internal-displacement.org/global-report/grid2018/).
