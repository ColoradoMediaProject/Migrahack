### Census

There are tables on age ranges for those under 18 by county and another for school enrollment for native-born, foreign-born, foreign-born citizens and foreign-born non-citizens for 2010 and 2017. Only large counties are represented because sample sizes aren't large enough in smaller counties. These are 5-year estimates from [American Community Survey Table SO501](https://data.census.gov/cedsci/table?t=Native%20and%20Foreign%20Born&table=S0501&tid=ACSST5Y2017.S0501&hidePreview=true&lastDisplayedRow=158&g=0400000US08.050000). Identical tables are in the population/census folders.

Also included is an ACS one-year estimate on ages, note that it differs somewhat from the five-year estimates including a calculated field for native-born and not distinction between citizen/non-citizen.

### Unaccompanied minors

The Washington Post published a story on [this topic this week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/immigrant-kids-fill-this-towns-schools-their-bus-driver-resents-the-system-that-brought-them-here/2019/09/22/861c0fb4-d321-11e9-9610-fb56c5522e1c_story.html) using data from [Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/ucs/about). There are statistics just for Colorado from October 2013 through July 2019, for all states; and for counties in Colorado and the nation for 2019. General statistics about [unaccompanied minors](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/ucs/facts-and-data) are given for the entire nation on the agency's data page.
