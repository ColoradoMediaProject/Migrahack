### Unaccompanied minors

The Washington Post published a story on [this topic this week](https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/immigration/immigrant-kids-fill-this-towns-schools-their-bus-driver-resents-the-system-that-brought-them-here/2019/09/22/861c0fb4-d321-11e9-9610-fb56c5522e1c_story.html) using data from [Department of Health and Human Services Office of Refugee Resettlement](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/programs/ucs/about). There are statistics just for Colorado from October 2013 through July 2019, for all states; and for counties in Colorado and the nation for 2019. General statistics about [unaccompanied minors](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/orr/about/ucs/facts-and-data) are given for the entire nation on the agency's data page.
