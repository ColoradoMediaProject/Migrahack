# Employment data
### Everify folder
This includes a file of [Colorado businesses](https://www.e-verify.gov/about-e-verify/e-verify-data/how-to-find-participating-employers) enrolled in the E-Verify program as well as a file of [national E-verify use](https://www.e-verify.gov/about-e-verify/e-verify-data/e-verify-usage-statistics) statistics.

### Work visas

The Department of Labor issues several types of work visas for permanent and temporary employees. Those types of visas are [described here](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/hiring.cfm). Folders include permanent visas, H-1B visas for professional workers, H-2A for seasonal agriculture workers and H-2B for non-agriculture workers.

Data for these types of visas comes from the [disclosure data](https://www.foreignlaborcert.doleta.gov/performancedata.cfm) tab.

The Colorado-related data includes employers with a Colorado address and worksites with a Colorado address.

### ICE contracts

This data comes from [Sludge](https://readsludge.com/). Reporter Alex Kotch [cleaned up and analyzed](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Tut9q-Clcfc8ryueATzEZGZor2_7elFH0_JTM8GE_Yg/edit#gid=858397753) [federal contract data](usaspending.gov) from 2010 through July 29, 2019.

### Wage Theft

The Colorado Department of Labor and Employment [tracks wage theft allegations](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bU04n7MO8ngOiFWwn96L_fJQy3wo6WcoZilfKbe8Ajc/edit#gid=1757802295), but doesn't include information on country of birth or citizenship. This still might be useful, since immigrants are often the victims of wage theft.
