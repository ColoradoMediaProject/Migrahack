The file here includes total enrollment and international/non-resident alien enrollment at selected Colorado colleges and universities. The numbers are for fall census counts, though not all schools have done 2019 counts. And not all have data for all prior years.

The csv file includes a field with a link to the source data. If you want to add an institution google it plus "institutional research." Many have the common data set posted for several years.

The National Association of International Educators has a [tool to calculate the economic impact](https://www.nafsa.org/policy-and-advocacy/policy-resources/nafsa-international-student-economic-value-tool) of international students.
