# Population data

### Census data
These folders include American Community Survey five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau

The nativity folder includes county level estimates for 2017, 2015 and 2010 of total population, native born population, foreign born population, foreign born with citizenship and foreign born without citizenship. Note that the American Community Survey is a sample, not an attempt to count all people in the United States like the census. It does ask a question about citizenship.

The historic nativity folder includes data on nativity in the nation, region and by state from 1850 through 2010.

### Lawful permanent residents

Department of Homeland Security tracks people who become lawful permanent residents each year by state, metro areas and includes demographics. The main statewide files are combined from those originals. Original files are in the original folder. There are also files for Core Based Statistical Areas of Residence from 2005 on and Metropolitan Statistical Areas for 2003 & 2004 in individual city files ; they are originals by year. The data comes from the [DHS Profiles of Lawful Permanent Residents](https://www.dhs.gov/profiles-lawful-permanent-residents). Note that Silverthorne changes to Breckenridge, and there is [no data for 2014](https://www.dhs.gov/profiles-legal-permanent-residents-2014-cbsa) for either.
