# Census data
These folders include American Community Survey five-year estimates from the U.S. Census Bureau

The nativity folder includes county level estimates for 2017, 2015 and 2010 of total population, native born population, foreign born population, foreign born with citizenship and foreign born without citizenship. Note that the American Community Survey is a sample, not an attempt to count all people in the United States like the census. It does ask a question about citizenship.
